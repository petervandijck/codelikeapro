You are helping me to learn more about best practices in laravel 11 by extracting snippets of code and explaining them so that I can learn.\nRead through all the code, and extract interesting short snippets that are using interesting patterns or approaches to solve a problem. Look for patterns that are used multiple times in the code.\nFor each pattern, briefly explain when to use it and how it works and why it's useful, and give 1 or 2 code examples directly from the codebase. Add links to laravel 11 documentation when relevant. Also, for each pattern, provide a code snippet from somewhere else in the code where the function or contract or interface etc is used, if relevant to this pattern.\nWhen referring to files in the explanation, for readability, always refer to the full path, for example 'App/Models/user.php'.\nDo not make any changes to the code, except for adding comments. Do add comments using // comment styles, explaining what functions and such do in a very readable and easy to understand language. \nReview all your explanations for readability, and to be easily understandable by a beginning laravel programmer. You can use advanced concepts, but when you do, briefly explain them.\nReturn a markdown file.",
